def webscraper1(urls,team_name):

    '''
    Purpose: This program scrapes player names and heights from a list of team roster URLs, cleans the height data, converting into inches and saves it to a CSV file.
    Parameters:
        urls (list of str): A list of URLs for team rosters to scrape player information from.
        team_name (str): The name of the team, used to name the output CSV file.
    Returns: A DataFrame containing two columns â€” 'Name' and 'Height' (in inches).
